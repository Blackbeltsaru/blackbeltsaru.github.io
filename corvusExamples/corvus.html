						<h1>Corvus Engine</h1>

					<p>Corvus Engine is being built as an excersize in learning game engine architecture. The main goal
						was originally to understand the graphics pipeline. That has since extended to understand how
						all of the pieces of a game engine communicate. Additionally, I am building Corvus Engine to give myself 
						a platform to implement new projects. I often find myself wanting to implement projects that 
						require visualizations. Up until this point I have been using frameworks that allow for easy 
						visual development such as <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> or <a href="https://love2d.org/">
						LÖVE</a>. However, I am the kind of person who would prefer write all of the code from scratch 
						rather than use libraries or frameworks.
					</p>
					<p>I am frequently asked; "Why are you writing a game egine in Javascript?", and the answer is quite simple.
						I intend this project to be a learning experience, therefore, I find myself referencing many resources 
						and tutorials throughout the development process. Many of these resources are specifically written for 
						C/C++ development. I believe that following a tutorial and copying the code directly does not lead 
						to understanding. Additionally, by using Javascript I have easy access to the graphics library WebGL, 
						which allows me to practice working in the graphics pipeline. All of these points have lead me to choose 
						to develop in Javascript. I do have plans to take what I learn through this process and build Corvus 
						Engine in C/C++, but that is a future project.

					<h2>Current Features</h2>

					<h3>Logging</h3>
					<p>Corvus Engine has a nearly complete logging solution with both a core and a client logger. The 
						core logger is used to log messages from inside the engine iteself, while the client logger 
						is used to allow a client implementing Corvus Engine to access all of the logging features. 
					<br>
					<br>
						Corvus Engine's logger has the following log levels: <br>
						<blockquote>
							&#8226; <b>TRACE</b> <br>
							&#8226; <b>DEBUG</b> <br>
							&#8226; <b>INFO </b> <br>
							&#8226; <b>WARN </b> <br>
							&#8226; <b>ERROR</b> <br>
							&#8226; <b>FATAL</b> <br>
							Any message logged at FATAL will immediatly log a stack trace as well.<br>
						</blockquote>
					    The log level is configurable by the client. Any message logged at a level lower than the 
						level configured by the client will be ignored. 
					</p>

					<h3>Eventing</h3>
					<p>Corvus Engine's eventing structure is build to be easily expandable. When the window 
						is built an event callback is registered. Every time the window fires an event, the 
						callback is invoked with the event as a argument. This allows the window to function 
						without needing any context about the rest of the engine. 
						<br><br>
						Corvus Engine implements its own event holders. This allows for straight forward 
						platform migration. Read more about this at <a href="#platformIndependence">Platform Isolation</a>. 
						These events belong to one or many event categories. For example a <b>Mouse Down</b> event belongs to 
						the <b>Mouse Button</b>, <b>Mouse</b>, and <b>Input</b> categories. The purpose of event categories 
						is to allow multiple event types to be caught by a single handler. 
					</p>

					<h3>Layers</h3>
					<p>Corvus Engine implements Layers and a Layer Stack. Layers are how a client interacts with
						Corvus Engine. A client will implement a Layer and push said Layer onto the applications 
						Layer Stack. From that point on, the layer will recieve events, provided a Layer higher in 
						the stack has not already handled the event, as well as update calls. I have opted not to 
						force Layers to have a render call because there are situations in which the update logic 
						and the render logic may be tied together. 
					</p>

					<h3 id="platformIndependence">Platform Isolation</h3>
					<p>Corvus Engine is implemented in such a way that all of the platform specific logic is isolated
						within those platform specific code sections. For example, Corvus Engine has its own event 
						containers. When the browser fires an event, that event is caught and transformed into a Corvus 
						specific event and propagated throughout the application. Similar isolation occurs with the window
						and the rendering context. Therefore, if I wanted to allow Corvus Engine to be run headless, in 
						Node for example, I would only have to implement a headless window and rendering context, rather 
						than re-implement the entirety of the engine.
